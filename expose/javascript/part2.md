1. It will log the value of i at the end of the loop, which is prices.length
2. It will log the value of 'discountedPrice' at the end of the loop
3. It will log the value of 'finalPrice' at the end of the loop
4. The function will return the array 'discounted'. This is due to 'discounted' being initialized as an array at line 3.
5. Line 12 will cause an error due to the value of i not being in the same scope as 'console.log(i)'
6. Line 13 will cause an error due to the value of 'discountedPrice' not being in the same scope as 'console.log(discountedPrice)'
7. Line 14 will log the value of 'finalPrice' at the end of the loop
8. The function will return the array 'discounted'. This is due to 'discounted' being initialized as an array at line 3 and is in the same scope as the return function.
9. Line 11 will cause an error due to the value of i not being in the same scope as 'console.log(i)'
10. Line 12 will log the value of 'length' at the end of the array
11. The function will return the array 'discounted'. This is due to 'discounted' being initialized as an array at line 3 and is in the same scope as the return function.
12. A. student.name
    B. student["Grad Year"]
    C. student.greeting()
    D. student["Favorite Teacher"].name
    E. student.courseLoad[0]
13. A. 5, string '3' becomes number 3 and adds with 2
    B. 1, string '3' becomes number 3 and subtracts with 2
    C. 3, null is the value of 0
    D. 3, string '3' is typecasted to number 3 and is added to 0, which is the value of null
    E. 4, the value of true is 1, and is added to 3
    F. 0, the value of false is 0, and the value of null is 0
    G. NaN, adding an undefined value will not result in a number
    H. NaN, subtracting an undefined value will not result in a number
14. A. true, string '2' becomes number 2 and is compared to 1
    B. true, string '2' and '12' becomes numbers 2 and 12 respectively and are compared to each other
    C. true, string '2' becomes number 2 and is compared to 2
    D. false, string '2' is not automatically typecasted and remains a string, which is not true
    E. false, 'true' is equal to the value of 1 and is compared to 2
    F. true, 'Boolean(2)' is of boolean type and equals the value of true
15. '==' is equality comparator that automatically typecasts the values being compared, allowing a string to be compared with a number. However, '===' does not typecast and checks if they're the same type.
